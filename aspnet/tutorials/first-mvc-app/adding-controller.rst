Adding a controller
==================================================

By `Rick Anderson`_

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an app into three main components: the **M**\odel, the **V**\iew, and the **C**\ontroller. The MVC pattern helps you create apps that are testable and easier to maintain and update than traditional monolithic apps. MVC-based apps contain:

- **M**\odels: Classes that represent the data of the app and that use validation logic to enforce business rules for that data. Typically, model objects retrieve and store model state in a database. In this tutorial, a ``Movie`` model retrieves movie data from a database, provides it to the view or updates it. Updated data is written to a SQL Server database.
- **V**\iews: Views are the components that display the app's user interface (UI). Generally, this UI displays the model data. 
- **C**\ontrollers: Classes that handle browser requests, retrieve model data, and then specify view templates that return a response to the browser. In an MVC app, the view only displays information; the controller handles and responds to user input and interaction. For example, the controller handles route data and query-string values, and passes these values to the model. The model might use these values to query the database.

The MVC pattern helps you create apps that separate the different aspects of the app (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements. The pattern specifies where each kind of logic should be located in the app. The UI logic belongs in the view. Input logic belongs in the controller. Business logic belongs in the model. This separation helps you manage complexity when you build an app, because it enables you to work on one aspect of the implementation at a time without impacting the code of another. For example, you can work on the view code without depending on the business logic code. 

We'll be covering all these concepts in this tutorial series and show you how to use them to build a simple movie app. The following image shows the *Models*, *Views* and *Controllers* folders in the MVC project.

Replace the contents of *Controllers/HelloWorldController.cs* with the following: 

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Controllers/HelloWorldController.cs
  :language: c#
  :lines: 5-28
  
Every ``public`` method in a controller is callable as an HTTP endpoint. In the sample above, both methods return a string.  Note the comments preceding each method:

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Controllers/HelloWorldController.cs
  :language: c#
  :lines: 10-28
  :dedent: 4
  :emphasize-lines: 4,12

The first comment states this is an `HTTP GET <http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp>`__ method that is invoked by appending "/HelloWorld/" to the URL. The second comment specifies an `HTTP GET <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html>`__ method that is invoked by appending "/HelloWorld/Welcome/" to the URL. Later on in the tutorial we'll use the scaffolding engine to generate ``HTTP POST`` methods.

Run the app in non-debug mode (press Ctrl+F5) and append "HelloWorld" to the path in the address bar. (In the image below, http://localhost:1234/HelloWorld is used, but you'll have to replace *1234* with the port number of your app.) The ``Index method`` returns a string. You told the system to return some HTML, and it did!

MVC invokes controller classes (and the action methods within them) depending on the incoming URL. The default URL routing logic used by MVC uses a format like this to determine what code to invoke:

``/[Controller]/[ActionName]/[Parameters]``

You set the format for routing in the *Startup.cs* file.

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Startup.cs
  :language: c#
  :lines: 80-85
  :dedent: 12
  :emphasize-lines: 5

When you run the app and don't supply any URL segments, it defaults to the "Home" controller and the "Index" method specified in the template line highlighted above. 

The first URL segment determines the controller class to run. So ``localhost:xxxx/HelloWorld`` maps to the ``HelloWorldController`` class. The second part of the URL segment determines the action method on the class. So ``localhost:xxxx/HelloWorld/Index`` would cause the ``Index`` method of the ``HelloWorldController`` class to run. Notice that we only had to browse to ``localhost:xxxx/HelloWorld`` and the ``Index`` method was called by default. This is because ``Index`` is the default method that will be called on a controller if a method name is not explicitly specified. The third part of the URL segment ( ``Parameters``) is for route data. We'll see route data later on in this tutorial.

Browse to ``http://localhost:xxxx/HelloWorld/Welcome``. The ``Welcome`` method runs and returns the string "This is the Welcome action method...". The default MVC routing is ``/[Controller]/[ActionName]/[Parameters]``. For this URL, the controller is ``HelloWorld`` and ``Welcome`` is the action method. We haven't used the ``[Parameters]`` part of the URL yet.

.. image:: adding-controller/_static/welcome.png

Let's modify the example slightly so that you can pass some parameter information  from the URL to the controller (for example, ``/HelloWorld/Welcome?name=Scott&numtimes=4``).  Change the ``Welcome`` method  to include two parameters as shown below. Note that the code uses the C# optional-parameter feature to indicate that the ``numTimes`` parameter defaults to 1 if no value is passed for that parameter.

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Controllers/HelloWorldController.cs
  :language: c#
  :lines: 51-55
  :dedent: 8

.. note:: The code above uses ``HttpUtility.HtmlEncode`` to protect the app from malicious input (namely JavaScript).

.. note:: In Visual Studio 2015, when you are running without debugging (Ctl+F5), you don't need to build the app after changing the code. Just save the file, refresh your browser and you can see the changes.

Run your app and browse to:

  ``http://localhost:xxxx/HelloWorld/Welcome?name=Rick&numtimes=4``

(Replace xxxx with your port number.) You can try different values for ``name`` and ``numtimes`` in  the URL. The MVC model binding system automatically maps the named parameters from  the query string in the address bar to parameters in your method. See :doc:`/mvc/models/model-binding` for more information.

.. image:: adding-controller/_static/rick4.png

In the sample above, the URL segment (``Parameters``) is not used, the ``name`` and ``numTimes`` parameters are passed as `query strings <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string>`__. The ``?`` (question mark) in the above URL is a separator, and the query strings follow. The ``&`` character separates query strings.

Replace the ``Welcome`` method with the following code:

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Controllers/HelloWorldController.cs
  :language: c#
  :lines: 80-84
  :dedent: 8
  
Run the app and enter the following URL:  ``http://localhost:xxx/HelloWorld/Welcome/3?name=Rick``

.. image:: adding-controller/_static/rick_routedata.png

This time the third URL segment  matched the route parameter ``id``. The ``Welcome``  method contains a parameter  ``id`` that matched the URL template in the ``MapRoute`` method. The trailing ``?``  (in ``id?``) indicates the ``id`` parameter is optional.

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Startup.cs
  :language: c#
  :lines: 80-85
  :dedent: 12

In these examples the controller has been doing the "VC" portion  of MVC - that is, the view and controller work. The controller is returning HTML  directly. Generally you don't want controllers returning HTML directly, since  that becomes very cumbersome to code and maintain. Instead we'll typically use a separate Razor view template file to help generate the HTML response. We'll do that in the next tutorial.
